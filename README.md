# Creating a Memory Card Game with React

As an introduction to React, I was tasked with creating a card flipping memory game. This assignment involved using React, bootstrap, and css. CSS animation was used for the card flip. In order to track whether the card is flipped or not flipped I used this.setState(). 

## Tools

- React(JSX): to create app
- CSS: for styling, and card flip animation

## JSX Methods Used

- onClick: user clicks card which triggers card flip
- .slice(): to render each group of cards individually
- .map(): to spit out an array of cards according to the index and card (shuffling)
